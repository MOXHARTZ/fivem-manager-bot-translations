# HOW TO TRANSLATE
You can edit the locales in this folder. The `en.lua` is the default language. If you want to add a new language, you can copy the `en.lua` and rename it to the language code of your language. You can find a list of all language codes [here](https://www.andiamo.co.uk/resources/iso-language-codes/). After you have translated the file, you can add iso code to the `main.json` file. But please make sure that you have translated the whole file. If you have any questions, you can contact me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/davU2SY). 

# You can get 40% discount by adding your own language!
